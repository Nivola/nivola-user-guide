Access to CLI
=============

The ways to access on Command Line Interface (CLI) are two.
The first is using by the provider's users only:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh <login domnt>@cmpto1-cons02.site01.nivolapiemonte.it

The second, used by business user is:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh <login psnet>@cmpto2-cons02.site02.nivolapiemonte.it


The "login psnet" is provided by Nivola  Support Center.
